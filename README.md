<h1>Restaurants-Data</h1>

<h2>This is a Desktop Application</h2>
This application visits each restaurant (provided the link) and collects the data of each restaurant such as the store location, store ratings, the categories of products
and all the products present on the website for that particular store and displays them on the application.

If we needd to know the unavailable products of a restaurant there's a button to help us with that but before that we needd to add a csv file of that restuarant in the 
Menu folder. So, clicking the unavailable button gets us the unavailable products at that particular restaurant.

If we need need the data to be exported to Excel, there's a button for that as well. Clisking the button will export the data from the application to the Excel file in a
neatly fomatted manner for both available and unavailable products. You can find the unavilable products in the Folders (Excel_files and Excel_files_unavailable)

<h3>Steps to use the application</h3>
-You need to download the zip file and add the restaurants link in the links.txt file
-Change the csv files to the items of the restaurant you are looking for
-Open the application.
-Click on run (gets the data on all the restaurants provided on the links file)
-You can Click on Export to Excel to export the data to excel.
